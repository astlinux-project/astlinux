Subject: cgroup: Move rcu_head up near the top of cgroup_root

commit a7fb0423c201ba12815877a0b5a68a6a1710b23a upstream.

Commit d23b5c577715 ("cgroup: Make operations on the cgroup root_list RCU
safe") adds a new rcu_head to the cgroup_root structure and kvfree_rcu()
for freeing the cgroup_root.

The current implementation of kvfree_rcu(), however, has the limitation
that the offset of the rcu_head structure within the larger data
structure must be less than 4096 or the compilation will fail. See the
macro definition of __is_kvfree_rcu_offset() in include/linux/rcupdate.h
for more information.

By putting rcu_head below the large cgroup structure, any change to the
cgroup structure that makes it larger run the risk of causing build
failure under certain configurations. Commit 77070eeb8821 ("cgroup:
Avoid false cacheline sharing of read mostly rstat_cpu") happens to be
the last straw that breaks it. Fix this problem by moving the rcu_head
structure up before the cgroup structure.
