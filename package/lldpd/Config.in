	  lldpd is a 802.1ab implementation (LLDP) to help you locate
	  neighbors of all your equipments.

	  LLDP allows you to know exactly on which port is a server
	  (and reciprocally).

	  LLDP is an industry standard protocol designed to supplant
	  proprietary Link-Layer protocols such as EDP or CDP. The
	  goal of LLDP is to provide an inter-vendor compatible
	  mechanism to deliver Link-Layer notifications to adjacent
	  network devices.

	  lldpd is an ISC-licensed implementation of LLDP for various
	  Unixes. It also supports some proprietary protocols.
