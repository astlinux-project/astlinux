	  WireGuard is an extremely simple yet fast and modern VPN
	  that utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography. It aims to be
	  faster, simpler, leaner, and more useful than IPSec, while
	  avoiding the massive headache. It intends to be considerably
	  more performant than OpenVPN. WireGuard is designed as a
	  general purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces and
	  super computers alike, fit for many different circumstances.

	  Backports of the WireGuard kernel module for
	  Linux to 3.10 <= kernel <= 5.5.y, as an out-of-tree module.
