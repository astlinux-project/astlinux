Subject: [PATCH] manager.c:  Prevent the Originate action from running the Originate app

If an AMI user without the "system" authorization calls the
Originate AMI command with the Originate application,
the second Originate could run the "System" command.

Action: Originate
Channel: Local/1111
Application: Originate
Data: Local/2222,app,System,touch /tmp/owned

If the "system" authorization isn't set, we now block the
Originate app as well as the System, Exec, etc. apps.

+The AMI Originate action, which optionally takes a dialplan application as
