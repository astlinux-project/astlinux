	  The main goal of this project is to provide simple and robust
	  facilities for loadbalancing and high-availability to Linux
	  system and Linux based infrastructures. Loadbalancing framework
	  relies on well-known and widely used Linux Virtual Server (IPVS)
	  kernel module providing Layer4 loadbalancing. Keepalived
	  implements a set of checkers to dynamically and adaptively
	  maintain and manage loadbalanced server pool according their health.
