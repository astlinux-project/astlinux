[[followme-dialplan]]

Follow-Me Tab:

The Follow-Me tab uses Asterisk's internal database (astdb) to maintain a list of
Follow-Me numbers and their state.

In particular, Asterisk supports a Follow-Me application, which makes adding this feature
into your dialplan about as easy as it gets.

exten => s-BUSY,1,Voicemail(${ARG1},b)  ; If busy, send to voicemail w/ busy ann
exten => _s-.,1,Goto(s-NOANSWER,1)

---- /etc/asterisk/extensions.conf snippet ----

Warning!  The Follow-Me tab uses the astdb database Family: "followme", be warned if you already
use this in your dialplan!  The tab may be safely viewed, but clicking [Save Changes] will write
to the database.

The Asterisk followme.conf file is automatically edited and the Asterisk app_followme.so
application module is automatically reloaded.  Note that the source database is astdb, so
if you already have a followme.conf file, you will need to reenter your numbers into
the Follow-Me tab.

The Prefs tab has several options for the Follow-Me tab...

=> Follow-Me Numbers Displayed: 1 - 6

The number of numbers available in the Follow-Me tab, defaults to 4.

=> Schedule Menu: | Never~Skip Local Dial |

The Schedule menu will appear in the Follow-Me tab if this text entry is defined.  A list
of tilde (~) seperated strings can be defined.  The result will be a menu starting with
"Always" and then followed in the order of your defined list.  The value of "Always" is 0,
your first string is 1, etc...  This value is easily retrieved from a dialplan, but is not
automatically supported by the Asterisk Follow-Me application.  Another example...

---- /etc/asterisk/extensions.conf snippet ----

[macro-ring-inside]
exten => s,1,GotoIf($[${DB_EXISTS(followme/${ARG1})}=0]?100)

exten => s,n,Voicemail(${ARG1},u)
; Local Dial then Voicemail
exten => s,100,Dial(SIP/${ARG1},20)
exten => s,n,Voicemail(${ARG1},u)

---- /etc/asterisk/extensions.conf snippet ----

=> Use Caller*ID Tab Number Format Rules for Follow-Me

This option is checked by default, giving a sanity check to your phone number entries.  The
administrator can define the format rule or simply uncheck to disable this feature.

All three security levels are supported by the Follow-Me tab: admin, staff and 'numbered' user.
The non-admin 'numbered' user can only edit the status of their Follow-Me numbers.

Note that when the web interface, Follow-Me -> Dial Numbers: [ Single number without callee prompt ]
is selected, the Followme() application immediately handles the number using the specified dialplan context.
For this "without callee prompt" case, the Followme() application does not return, any NOANSWER or BUSY
Dial() ${DIALSTATUS} values either need to be handled in your dialplan when dialing Follow-Me numbers,
or use the destination device (Cell/Mobile Phone Voicemail) to handle exceptions.


[[sysdial-dialplan]]

Speed Dial Tab:

The Speed Dial tab adds a web dialog interface to the asterisk
astdb database, using Family: sysdial.

The Name entries are saved in the asterisk astdb database, using Family: sysdialname.

If a Speed Dial entry contains a "Name", the name and and extension will automatically appear
in the Directory tab.

The example prefix is "11", but that is your choosing
in your extensions.conf dialplan.  The Prefs tab allows this
prefix "label" to be changed.

The number of speed dial entries defaults to 50, with digits "00 to 49".
The Prefs tab allows the user to set the digits from "00 to 09" through
"00 to 99".  This allows the Speed Dial tab to match your
extensions.conf dialplan logic with up to 100 speed dial entries.

Below is an example extensions.conf snippet:

---- /etc/asterisk/extensions.conf snippet ----

exten => _11[01234]X,1,Macro(dial-sysdial,${EXTEN:2:2}) ; DB: sysdial/00-49

[macro-dial-sysdial]
exten => s,1,Answer
exten => s,n,GotoIf($[${DB_EXISTS(sysdial/${ARG1})} = 0]?100)
exten => s,n,Set(CALLERID(num)=${HOME_CIDNUM})
exten => s,n,Set(CALLERID(name)=${HOME_CIDNAME})
exten => s,n,DIAL(${DB_RESULT},${DIALOUTTIME})
exten => s,n,Hangup

exten => s,100,Playback(extras/num-not-in-db)
exten => s,n,Hangup

---- /etc/asterisk/extensions.conf snippet ----


[[cidname-dialplan]]

Caller*ID Tab:

The Caller*ID tab adds a web dialog interface to the asterisk
astdb database, using Family: cidname

The Prefs tab contains some relevant options.
The default "Number Format:"
matches the NANPA numbering system for North America.

^[2-9][0-9][0-9][2-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]$

The "Number Format:" specification is very flexible, using the
standard UNIX regular expression syntax.

Another example, allow any number 0-9 with at least 6 digits and at most
16 digits.

^[0-9]{6,16}$

Below is an example extensions.conf snippet:

---- /etc/asterisk/extensions.conf snippet ----

exten => s,100,GotoIf($[${DB_EXISTS(cidname/${CALLERID(num)})} = 0]?200)
exten => s,n,Set(CALLERID(name)=${DB_RESULT:0:15})

exten => s,200,NoOp(${CALLERID(num)})

---- /etc/asterisk/extensions.conf snippet ----


[[blacklist-dialplan]]

Blacklist Tab:

The Blacklist tab adds a web dialog interface to the asterisk
astdb database, using Family: blacklist

The Prefs tab contains some relevant options.
The default "Number Format:"
matches the NANPA numbering system for North America.

^[2-9][0-9][0-9][2-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]$

The "Number Format:" specification is very flexible, using the
standard UNIX regular expression syntax.

exten => s,n,GotoIf($["${DB_RESULT}" = "2"]?120)
exten => s,n,Goto(blacklist,s,1)        ; "1" TN in blacklist database, answer and Zapateller

exten => s,110,Goto(blacklist,no-answer,1) ; "0" TN in blacklist, don't answer
exten => s,120,Goto(voicemail-ivr,s,1)  ; "2" TN in blacklist, direct to voicemail

exten => s,200,NoOp(Valid TN:${CALLERID(num)})

---- /etc/asterisk/extensions.conf snippet ----


[[whitelist-dialplan]]

Whitelist Tab:

The Whitelist tab adds a web dialog interface to the asterisk
astdb database, using Family: whitelist

The Prefs tab contains some relevant options.
The default "Number Format:"
matches the NANPA numbering system for North America.

^[2-9][0-9][0-9][2-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]$

The "Number Format:" specification is very flexible, using the
standard UNIX regular expression syntax.

---- /etc/asterisk/extensions.conf snippet ----


[[actionlist-dialplan]]

Actionlist Tab:

The Actionlist tab adds a web dialog interface to the asterisk
astdb database, using Family: actionlist

The Prefs tab contains some relevant options.

The "Key Format:" specification is very flexible, using the
standard UNIX regular expression syntax.

Example, allow any alphanumeric with at least 2 characters and at most
16 characters.

^[A-Za-z0-9]{2,16}$

Below is an example extensions.conf snippet:

[[sqldata-dialplan]]

SQL-Data Tab:

The SQL-Data Tab adds a web dialog to edit the SQLite3 database (added in AstLinux 1.1.1).
The database exists in "/mnt/kd/asterisk-odbc.sqlite3".

The Prefs tab contains relevant options under "SQL-Data Tab Options:".

The "Create SIP & Phone standard SQL schema" (checked by default),
automatically creates the standard table structure for the SQLite3 database.

You can access the database via Asterisk with user defined "func_odbc" functions, where
you can define customized database queries and more. A quite universal example for an entry
in the "func_odbc.conf" would be:

Credit: Michael Keuter
---- /etc/asterisk/func_odbc.conf snippet ----

[SIPUSERS]
dsn=asterisk
readsql=SELECT ${SQL_ESC(${ARG1})} FROM sip_users WHERE ${SQL_ESC(${ARG2})}='${SQL_ESC(${ARG3})}'

---- /etc/asterisk/func_odbc.conf snippet ----

For example, if you want to find the SIP-user belonging to the internal extension "101"
(as defined in your database), this could be accessed in the Asterisk dialplan
like this:

---- /etc/asterisk/extensions.conf snippet ----

; ODBC Test
exten => 999,1,NoOp(ODBC Query Test)
;
; ODBC_SIPUSERS: SELECT ARG1 FROM sip_users WHERE ARG2=ARG3
;   in the case: SELECT sipuser FROM sip_users WHERE ext_intern=101
;
same => n,Set(val=${ODBC_SIPUSERS(sipuser,ext_intern,101)})
same => n,NoOp(ODBC-ReturnValue: ${val})
same => n,Hangup()

---- /etc/asterisk/extensions.conf snippet ----


[[xmpp-shared-groups]]

XMPP Shared Groups:

Groups were designed to allow administrators to create virtual groups of users that automatically
see each other in their contact lists. The shared groups will be sent to the user along with
their usual roster without overriding or permanently adding the contacts. There is no need for
the user to authorize these contacts in their contact list, this is done automatically on the
server (be careful: everyone in a group can monitor the presence of each other!).

As an example, if you have a team of people working together on a project, you can create a group
for that team. They will automatically be added to each others' contact lists, and the list can
easily be modified on the server at any time to add and remove people.

Note: Clicking "Shared Groups: ... - { Reload }" will apply { Edit Groups } changes without
      requiring the server to be restarted.

Example: "/mnt/kd/prosody/sharedgroups.conf"
--
[Support Team]
support@example.com
john.doe@example.com

[Development Team]
hardworkingdeveloper@example.net=Joe Coder
other.dev@example.com=Mel
--
You can see the last two entries here have custom names, if no name is given then it is up to
the user's client to find a suitable name (e.g. take it from the contact's vcard/profile).

[[Fossil-Commands]]

Fossil Commands:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AstLinux "helper" scripts for Fossil
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The "fossil-status" command:

Usage: fossil-status

Report on the status of the current checkout.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The "fossil-diff" command:

Usage: fossil-diff [options] [FILE1 FILE2 ...]

Show the difference between the current version of each of the FILEs
specified (as they exist on disk) and that same file as it was checked
out.  Or if the FILE arguments are omitted, show the unsaved changed
currently in the working check-out.

If the "--from VERSION" or "-r VERSION" option is used it specifies
the source check-in for the diff operation.  If not specified, the
source check-in is the base check-in for the current check-out.

If the "--to VERSION" option appears, it specifies the check-in from
which the second version of the file or files is taken.  If there is
no "--to" option then the (possibly edited) files in the current check-out
are used.

The "-N" or "--new-file" option causes the complete text of added or
deleted files to be displayed.

The "--diff-binary" option enables or disables the inclusion of binary files
when using an external diff program.

The "--binary" option causes files matching the glob PATTERN to be treated
as binary when considering if they should be used with external diff program.
This option overrides the "binary-glob" setting.

Options:
  --binary PATTERN           Treat files that match the glob PATTERN as binary
  --branch BRANCH            Show diff of all changes on BRANCH
  --brief                    Show filenames only
  --context|-c N             Use N lines of context
  --diff-binary BOOL         Include binary files when using external commands
  --from|-r VERSION          select VERSION as source for the diff
  --side-by-side|-y          side-by-side diff
  --strip-trailing-cr        Strip trailing CR
  --to VERSION               select VERSION as target for the diff
  --unified                  unified diff
  -v|--verbose               output complete text of added or deleted files
  -w|--ignore-all-space      Ignore white space when comparing lines
  -W|--width <num>           Width of lines in side-by-side diff
  -Z|--ignore-trailing-space Ignore changes to end-of-line whitespace

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The "fossil-commit" command:

Usage: fossil-commit [comment-text]

Create a new revision containing all of the changes in the current checkout.

If no comment-text is provided, "auto commit via cron" will be used.

All files that have changed will be committed, including added and removed files.

Options:
  comment-text        use as commit comment message

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The "fossil-revert" command:

Usage: fossil-revert [/mnt/kd/]FILE [hex_revision_num]

Revert to the current repository version of FILE, or to
the version associated with baseline hex_revision_num.

If FILE was part of a rename operation, both the original file
and the renamed file are reverted.

Options:
  hex_revision_num    revert given FILE back to given REVISION

[[ACME-Certificate]]

---------------------------------
ACME (Let's Encrypt) Certificates
---------------------------------
AstLinux uses the "acme-client" command as a front-end to the core acme.sh script provided by the https://github.com/Neilpang/acme.sh project.

The acme-client command limits issued certificates to only use DNS challenge validation, as such you need a supported DNS provider, of which there are well over 20 as of this writing.

The Command Line Interface (CLI) must be used to initially issue and deploy ACME certificates.


------------------
ACME Configuration
------------------
Use the web interface "Network tab -> ACME (Let's Encrypt) Certificate:" section to define which services will be deployed ACME certificates.

The "ACME Account Email Address" registration email address is used for expiry notifications, while optional it seems like a good idea to specify.

In order to apply web interface settings changes, use the CLI command:

CLI> gen-rc-conf


--------------------
Issuing Certificates
--------------------
This example on host pbx4 uses the acme-client command, the core acme.sh version can be obtained by issuing:

CLI> acme-client --version
https://github.com/Neilpang/acme.sh
v2.7.2

Only DNS challenge validation is supported within AstLinux, as such you need a supported DNS provider, in this example we are using Cloudflare. We need to export the CF_Key and CF_Email variables, adjust to match your credentials ...

CLI> export CF_Key="sdfdxxxxxxxosdfgje"
CLI> export CF_Email="email@example.com"

Other DNS providers require different exported variables, see the acme.sh documentation for the details.

Now for the fundamental CLI command, where we issue a new certificate for the single domain "pbx4.example.org" ...

CLI> acme-client --issue --dns dns_cf -d pbx4.example.org

[Sat Jul  1 10:10:17 CDT 2017] And the full chain certs is there:  /mnt/kd/acme/pbx4.example.org/fullchain.cer

After the certificates are issued, they need to be deployed to the various services that can utilize them.
In this example only "HTTPS Server" is checked after "ACME Deploy Service:" in the web interface.

CLI> acme-client --deploy --deploy-hook astlinux -d pbx4.example.org
Stopping lighttpd...
Starting lighttpd...
acme-client: New ACME certificates deployed for HTTPS and 'lighttpd' restarted
[Sat Jul  1 10:14:10 CDT 2017] Success

While not required, it is a good idea to unset the exported variables above that contain the DNS challenge validation credentials.

CLI> unset CF_Key
CLI> unset CF_Email

NOTE: The DNS challenge validation credentials remain stored in the /mnt/kd/acme/account.conf file so auto-renewals can be performed via cron.

SPECIAL NOTE: Depending on the acme.sh DNS provider script, some scripts store the exported credentials variable names exactly in /mnt/kd/acme/account.conf and others prepend SAVED_ to the variable names.  When the credentials variable names are stored exactly any later changes to the credentials must be done by editing /mnt/kd/acme/account.conf.  When the credentials variable names have SAVED_ prepended you may use "export ..." later to change the saved credentials.

--------------------------
Auto-Renewing Certificates
--------------------------
Let's Encrypt certificates are only valid for 90 days, renewable after 60 days from the issue date. As such it is important to automate the process of renewing the certificate, this can be done by installing a cron entry using the command:

CLI> acme-client --install-cronjob
acme-client: Successfully added cron entry.


----------------------------
Multiple Domain Certificates
----------------------------
In the example above only one domain pbx4.example.org was specified. Let's Encrypt allows multiple domains to be specified with valid "Subject Alternative Name" entries in a single certificate. This assumes the DNS A and/or AAAA and/or SRV record of each domain points to the server with the issued certificate.

As an additional example let's say both example.org and subdomain pbx4.example.org are valid DNS entries you want to include in the "Subject Alternative Name" of the issued certificate.

Proceed as above, but simply include -d example.org when issuing the certificate, (specify the more general domain first) ...

CLI> acme-client --issue --dns dns_cf -d example.org -d pbx4.example.org

Likewise, when deploying the certificate, though you only need to specify the first -d example.org domain ...

CLI> acme-client --deploy --deploy-hook astlinux -d example.org


-----------------------
Additional CLI Commands
-----------------------
Some additional commands that may be useful to know ...

List the issued certificate(s):

CLI> acme-client --list

Revoke an issued certificate by domain:

CLI> acme-client --revoke -d pbx4.example.org

Remove a certificate by domain:

CLI> acme-client --remove -d pbx4.example.org


----------------
Advanced Options
----------------
For advanced users there may be situations where it would be useful to add special options for every occurrence of the acme-client command. Increasing the log-level and defining a log file would be one such example.

The /mnt/kd/acme/account.opts file does not exist by default, and needs to be manually created to enable this feature.

Example /mnt/kd/acme/account.opts file with persistent options added by acme-client to the acme.sh script:
-- /mnt/kd/acme/account.opts --
## acme.sh options

log-level 3
log /var/log/acme-client.log
--

[[WireGuard-Firewall-Rules]]

WireGuard Firewall Rules, WG->Local

Important -> The default policy is to allow all WG->Local traffic
             unless "Pass WG->Local" is defined, then
             the default policy is to deny all WG->Local traffic.

ICMP Echo Request (ping) packets are allowed and rate-limited for WG->Local traffic,
regardless of the "Firewall Rules:" choice.

TCP/UDP Syntax: host1,host2~port1,port2 host3,host4~port3,port4 ...

Example: (allow all WG->Local traffic, the default)
  Firewall Rules: [Deny WG->Local]
    TCP:
    UDP:

Example: (allow SSH traffic, deny all other)
  Firewall Rules: [Pass WG->Local]
    TCP: 0/0~22
    UDP:

Example: (deny HTTP/HTTPS traffic, allow all other)
  Firewall Rules: [Deny WG->Local]
    TCP: 0/0~80,443
    UDP:

Example: (allow SSH/HTTP/HTTPS and SIP/RTP-range traffic, deny all other)
  Firewall Rules: [Pass WG->Local]
    TCP: 0/0~22,80,443
    UDP: 0/0~5060,16384-16639

Example: (deny SSH/HTTP/HTTPS traffic for hosts 10.4.0.3 and 10.4.0.111 to 10.4.0.115, allow all other)
  Firewall Rules: [Deny WG->Local]
    TCP: 10.4.0.3,10.4.0.111-115~22,80,443
    UDP:

Example: (deny SSH/HTTP/HTTPS traffic for network 10.4.0.128/26 {10.4.0.129 to 10.4.0.190}, allow all other)
  Firewall Rules: [Deny WG->Local]
    TCP: 10.4.0.128/26~22,80,443
    UDP:

 Tip -> When possible, use network CIDR notation for an IP range rather than N.N.N.nnn-mmm syntax.
        The N.N.N.nnn-mmm syntax expands into MANY iptables rules.

 Tip -> When WireGuard is active, any changes to the "Firewall Options:" section can
        be applied by performing "Restart Firewall" from the Network or Edit tabs.
        "Restart (WireGuard) VPN" will also automatically restart the firewall,
        but will disrupt active WireGuard tunnels.

Note -> "Reload WireGuard VPN" will NOT automatically restart the firewall.

Note -> The main Network tab -> Firewall Configuration sub-tab has additional WireGuard options.
