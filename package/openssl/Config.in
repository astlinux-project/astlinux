config BR2_PACKAGE_OPENSSL_OCF
	bool "openssl ocf support"
	help
	  Enable openssl cryptodev (OCF) hardware acceleration support.
	  This requires kernel patches from the ocf-linux project otherwise
	  you'll just have a bigger openssl library that works as usual.
	  Note:  This needs to be moved to a separate package to work
	         as per upstream Buildroot using package "ocf-linux".
