	  s3fs allows a user to mount an S3 bucket via FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace).
	  s3fs makes you operate files and directories in S3 bucket like a local file system.
	  s3fs preserves the native object format for files.

	  s3fs is stable and is being used in a number of production environments, e.g., rsync backup to s3.
